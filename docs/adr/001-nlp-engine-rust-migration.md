# ADR 001: NLP Engine Migration To Rust (`nlprule` + `wordnet-db`)

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-06-25
- Note: project renamed from LexiAnki to LexiFlash on 2026-06-27. This ADR retains original naming for historical accuracy.

## Context

LexiAnki is currently a hybrid Python/Rust CLI application. The current roadmap targets a Rust-first desktop rewrite for v4.0.0 using Dioxus, with future expansion toward mobile and later AI-assisted features such as generated questions in the v6/v7 timeframe.

The main blocker for moving the NLP core fully into Rust is the current Python/NLTK dependency chain in `src/processor.py`. Today, the vocabulary extraction pipeline depends on:

- NLTK POS tagging
- NLTK WordNet lemmatization
- NLTK WordNet synset/lexname lookup
- Python-side stopword handling

That dependency chain is acceptable for the current CLI, but is a poor fit for a Rust-native desktop/mobile target. The goal of the spikes summarized here was to determine whether the current NLP pipeline can be replaced with a Rust-native implementation without carrying a Python runtime into the application.

Four technical spikes were completed:

1. `spikes/rust_bert_nlp/`: evaluate `rust-bert` + `tch` + `libtorch` for POS tagging
2. `spikes/nlprule_nlp/`: evaluate `nlprule` for POS tagging + lemmatization
3. `spikes/nlprule_processor_port/`: port the non-WordNet filtering logic from `src/processor.py`
4. `spikes/nlprule_processor_port/` extension: add WordNet lexname gating using `wordnet-db`

The core technical question was not just "can Rust do POS tagging?", but "can the existing processor behavior be reproduced closely enough in Rust to justify the migration?"

## Decision

Use:

- `nlprule` for POS tagging and lemmatization
- `wordnet-db` for WordNet lexname lookup
- Rust-native logic for all remaining filtering steps in `src/processor.py`

This means the planned Rust NLP engine for v4.0.0 should implement:

1. POS tagging
2. Proper noun filtering
3. Lowercase normalization
4. Pre-lemmatization token validation
5. POS mapping for downstream behavior
6. Lemmatization
7. Proper-adjective capitalization heuristic
8. WordNet lexname gate for capitalized tokens
9. Post-lemmatization validation
10. Stopword filtering
11. Known-word filtering
12. Deduplication with first-occurrence retention and context mapping

`rust-bert` / `tch` / `libtorch` are removed from consideration for this NLP engine decision.

Rationale:

- `rust-bert` can run POS tagging on this machine, but requires `tch` and `libtorch`
- the measured deploy/runtime cost is too high for this use case
- `rust-bert` does not solve lemmatization directly
- `nlprule` is materially lighter, faster to start, and already includes lemmatization

The migration accepts a measured behavior drift relative to the current Python pipeline:

- Recall of the Rust prototype vs the Python processor on the shared fixture: `29/31 = 93.55%`
- Effective mismatch floor on that fixture after adding the WordNet gate: `2/31 = 6.45%` (re-validated on the production port with repo `known_words.txt`: `30/32 = 93.75%`, see "Production Port Verification (Milestones 1-4)")

This drift is accepted as a model/data difference, not an engineering defect, for the current decision. The remaining observed mismatches are caused by POS/lemma differences between `nlprule` and the current NLTK+WordNet pipeline.

## Decision Data

### `rust-bert` vs `nlprule`

| Metric | `rust-bert` | `nlprule` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POS pipeline availability | Yes | Yes |
| Lemmatization availability | No built-in lemmatization pipeline used in spike | Yes |
| Clean release build time | ~`3m45s` to first failure, then ~`1m20s` after dependency workaround | `66.1s` |
| Build stability | Initial dependency failure (`indicatif` / `console` feature conflict) | No serious build failure in spike |
| Release binary size | `13 MB` | `16 MB` |
| Extra runtime/model assets | `95 MB` model cache + `967 MB` libtorch | `12 MB` `en_tokenizer.bin` used for POS+lemma; cache directory `~/.cache/nlprule` measured `19 MB` including `en_rules.bin` |
| Cold load on sample run | `2991 ms` model load | `571 ms` model load on 5-sentence sample |
| Cold load on ~230-token benchmark | `3049 ms` model load | `455 ms` model load |
| Throughput on ~230-token benchmark | `157 ms` POS inference | `44 ms` tokenize + POS + lemma |
| 5-sentence POS comparison vs NLTK | `43/46 = 93.48%` exact tag match | `41/46 = 89.13%` exact tag match, `42/46 = 91.30%` normalized POS match |
| Lemma comparison vs NLTK | Not applicable in spike | `44/46 = 95.65%` lemma match |
| License note | Depends on `tch` / `libtorch`; model cache in 100s of MB to GB range per crate docs | Crate is `MIT OR Apache-2.0`; binary data derived from LanguageTool v5.2 is `LGPLv2.1` |

### Why `rust-bert` was rejected

Measured during spike 1:

- `rust-bert` built only after a dependency workaround in the spike crate
- release binary was only `13 MB`, but deployment required:
  - `95 MB` model cache in `~/.cache/.rustbert`
  - `967 MB` libtorch runtime
- cold load was approximately `3.0s`
- POS-only inference on the ~230-token benchmark was `157 ms`
- lemmatization still required a separate solution

This cost is too high for the LexiAnki/LexiFlash NLP core, where the requirement is lightweight local processing, not transformer-grade semantic modeling.

### Why `nlprule` was accepted

Measured during spikes 2-4:

- release binary: `16 MB`
- tokenizer asset used for POS+lemma: `12 MB`
- `~/.cache/nlprule`: `19 MB`
- cold load on sample: `571 ms`
- cold load on ~230-token benchmark: `455 ms`
- tokenize + POS + lemma on ~230-token benchmark: `44 ms`
- no Python runtime required
- lemmatization is already included
- processor-port prototype reached `29/31 = 93.55%` recall vs the Python processor on the shared fixture once the WordNet gate was added

### License Risk

`nlprule` itself is licensed under `MIT OR Apache-2.0`, but the project README states:

> The nlprule binaries (`*.bin`) are derived from LanguageTool v5.2 and licensed under the LGPLv2.1 license.

This is a packaging/release risk that must be reviewed before any public release or commercial use. This ADR is not legal advice; it records a concrete technical licensing note discovered during the spike.

### Remaining Mismatches After WordNet Gate

The Rust processor-port prototype initially had a false mismatch caused by missing WordNet lexname gating:

- `american` appeared in Rust output but not Python output

After adding `wordnet-db` + lexname mapping from the same NLTK WordNet data:

- `american` disappeared from Rust-only output
- the remaining mismatches were:
  - `datasets` in Python vs `dataset` in Rust
  - `tagging` in Python vs dropped in Rust because `nlprule` produced `VBG -> tag`, which then failed the `len >= 5` validation rule

These are the currently observed mismatch examples that remain after removing the "missing WordNet gate" explanation.

## Production Port Verification (Milestones 1-4)

The Rust processor port described in this ADR has been implemented as a standalone production crate `lexianki_nlp` (kept isolated from the current Python CLI pipeline). The 12-step checklist from the Decision section is now fully implemented across 4 milestones:

- Milestone 1 (steps 1-4): `28bd0db`
- Milestone 2 (steps 5-6): `4898acd`
- Milestone 3 (steps 7-8): `15be4ff`
- Milestone 4 (steps 9-12): `3e07eb4`

Verification was re-run using the same fixture sentences as the original spikes, but with the repository `known_words.txt` as the known-word source (read-only). This is intentionally different from the spike fixture blacklist (`spikes/nlprule_processor_port/fixtures_known_words.txt`).

Observed production-port verification results:

- `known_words.txt` in the repository is currently empty, so known-word filtering does not remove any additional lemmas during verification
- Lemma-set recall (Rust vs Python on the verification fixture): `30/32 = 93.75%`
  - This differs slightly from the spike-era fixture measurement: `29/31 = 93.55%`
  - The difference is attributable to the measurement environment: using the real repo `known_words.txt` (empty) instead of the spike blacklist fixture
- Remaining mismatch signature matches the expected model drift:
  - `PYTHON_ONLY = [datasets, tagging]`
  - `RUST_ONLY = [dataset]`
  - Note: `tagging/tag` is no longer a "false mismatch": `nlprule` produces `tag`, which is correctly removed by step 9 (post-lemmatization `len >= 5` validation)

Context truncation implementation decision:

- The Python pipeline calls `lexianki_rs.truncate_context(...)`, but `lexianki_rs` is currently a PyO3 extension module, not a Rust library crate API that can be imported cleanly by `lexianki_nlp`
- Therefore, `truncate_context` was re-implemented in `lexianki_nlp` using the same algorithmic behavior:
  - case-insensitive match
  - alphabetic-boundary checks
  - balanced prefix/suffix context selection
  - ellipsis insertion
- Risk: there are now two implementations of the same context truncation algorithm (`lexianki_rs` and `lexianki_nlp`). If one changes and the other is not updated, behavior can drift over time. This should be resolved explicitly in follow-up work (single shared source of truth vs intentional duplication).

### Cost Of Adding WordNet

Measured in `spikes/nlprule_processor_port/`:

- before WordNet gate:
  - `model_load_ms = 290`
  - `process_ms = 54`
- after WordNet gate:
  - `model_load_ms = 426`
  - `wordnet_load_ms = 502`
  - `process_ms = 70`

Observed additional cost on the small fixture:

- `+502 ms` startup load time for WordNet
- `+16 ms` processing time

This overhead must be re-measured on a larger real-world corpus before it is treated as representative.

## Status

Accepted on `2026-06-25`.

This ADR applies to the NLP core planned for v4.0.0.

The UI framework decision (Dioxus) is out of scope for this ADR. This record only captures the NLP engine decision.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Removes the Python runtime from the planned NLP core
- Avoids `tch` / `libtorch` entirely
- Keeps runtime and deploy size materially smaller than the `rust-bert` path
- Keeps cold start much lower than the `rust-bert` path
- Preserves the ability to reproduce most of the current processor logic directly in Rust

### Negative / Risks To Track

- Extracted vocabulary output will differ from the current Python CLI output
- The difference is not necessarily a bug; it is a consequence of using a different NLP engine
- Migration between the current CLI and the future Rust app should communicate that output differences are expected
- `nlprule` binary data is under `LGPLv2.1`; packaging and release implications must be reviewed before public release or commercial use
- The spike measurements were taken on a small shared fixture (8 sentences) and a ~230-token synthetic benchmark; larger corpus validation is still required
- `nlprule` binary data is derived from LanguageTool v5.2, which is relatively old; availability of newer resources should be monitored
- The WordNet gate depends on bundling or otherwise shipping WordNet data files, which adds size and packaging complexity

## Follow-up Actions

Follow-up actions after the spike decision and the milestone-based production port:

1. Validate the spike results on a larger real corpus, such as one full VnExpress or BBC article, using both the Python processor and the Rust prototype
2. Review the practical implications of `LGPLv2.1` for `nlprule` binary data before any public release or commercial distribution
3. Decide how to bundle and update:
   - `nlprule` tokenizer data
   - WordNet data required by `wordnet-db`
4. Re-run startup and processing measurements on larger inputs once the real Rust processor implementation exists
5. DONE (Milestones 1-4): implement the Rust processor port checklist based on the current Python pipeline:
   - POS tagging
   - Proper noun filtering
   - Lowercase normalization
   - Pre-lemmatization token validation
   - POS mapping for downstream behavior
   - Lemmatization
   - Proper-adjective capitalization heuristic
   - WordNet lexname gate for capitalized tokens
   - Post-lemmatization validation
   - Stopword filtering
   - Known-word filtering
   - Deduplication with first-occurrence retention and context mapping
6. Confirm whether any additional spike is needed to reduce or better characterize the remaining mismatch floor (`datasets/dataset`, `tagging/tag`) before the production port starts
7. Decide how to handle duplication between `lexianki_rs::truncate_context` and `lexianki_nlp::truncate_context` (merge into a single shared implementation vs intentional duplication)
8. Re-validate known-word filtering with a non-empty `known_words.txt` to confirm behavior under more realistic conditions
